#Poetry Slam

In the spirit of Halloween, as it soon approaches, this program will take the poem "Haunted Houses" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and randomize the lines. Nothing is more scary than something you cant understand, after all.

There is a .txt file with each line of the poem written in order. 
There will be 3 functions, one prints the poem backwards, one prints it randomly, and one prints it with every two lines switched.
